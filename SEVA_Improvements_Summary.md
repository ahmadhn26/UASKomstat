# SEVA Dashboard Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the Socio-Economic Vulnerability Analyzer (SEVA) dashboard to fix download button functionality and modernize the application's appearance.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. File Path Issues
**Problem**: The application was looking for data files in absolute Windows paths (`"C:/Komstat 3/sovi_data.csv"`)
**Solution**: Changed to relative paths to work in any environment:
```r
# Before
sovi_data <- read.csv("C:/Komstat 3/sovi_data.csv")
distance_data <- read.csv("C:/Komstat 3/distance.csv")

# After  
sovi_data <- read.csv("sovi_data.csv")
distance_data <- read.csv("distance.csv")
```

### 2. Download Button Robustness
**Problem**: Download handlers could fail when required inputs were missing or invalid
**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling with `tryCatch()` blocks and fallback values:

#### Enhanced Normality Test Download
- Added default variable selection when none is chosen
- Added sample size validation (minimum 3 observations)
- Comprehensive error messages for troubleshooting

#### Enhanced Assumption Report Download  
- Improved content structure with clear sections
- Better handling of missing grouping variables
- Added summary and recommendations sections

#### Enhanced Regression Report Download
- Added model existence validation
- Detailed model specification and interpretation
- Comprehensive assumption testing results
- Added recommendations section

#### Enhanced Inferential Statistics Report
- Complete overview of all available tests
- Detailed explanations of when to use each test
