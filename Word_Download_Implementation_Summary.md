## Technical Implementation

### Format Change Rationale
- **Before:** PDF generation using complex LaTeX configurations
- **After:** Word document generation using simple R Markdown
- **Benefits:**
  - Higher reliability and compatibility
  - Better cross-platform support
  - Easier formatting and styling
  - Reduced dependency on LaTeX installations

### Content Enhancement
Each report now includes:
1. **Executive Summary:** High-level overview of the analysis
2. **Methodology:** Clear explanation of tests performed
3. **Results:** Comprehensive output tables and statistics
4. **Interpretations:** Plain-language explanations of findings
5. **Conclusions:** Actionable insights and recommendations
6. **Visual Elements:** Tables formatted with knitr::kable for professional appearance

### Error Handling
- Robust try-catch blocks for all download handlers
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Graceful handling of missing data or invalid inputs

## User Interface Updates

### Button Label Changes
- Updated button labels to reflect Word format instead of PDF
- Clear indication that reports are comprehensive and complete
- Maintained intuitive naming conventions

### Examples:
- `"Descriptive Interpretation (PDF)"` → `"Complete Descriptive Report (Word)"`
- `"Normality Test Results (PDF)"` → `"Complete Assumption Tests Report (Word)"`
- `"1-Sample T-Test (PDF)"` → `"Complete Inferential Statistics Report (Word)"`
- `"Regression Summary (PDF)"` → `"Complete Regression Analysis Report (Word)"`

## Benefits of Implementation

### For Users
1. **Reliability:** Word documents generate consistently without format issues
2. **Comprehensiveness:** Each report contains complete analysis with interpretations
3. **Professional Quality:** Well-formatted documents suitable for reporting
4. **Accessibility:** Word format is universally accessible and editable

### For Analysis
1. **Complete Reporting:** No need for multiple downloads - everything in one document
2. **Contextual Information:** Results are provided with proper statistical context
3. **Decision Support:** Clear recommendations based on statistical findings
4. **Documentation:** Proper methodology documentation for reproducibility

## File Size and Performance
- Word documents are typically smaller than equivalent PDF files
- Faster generation due to simpler processing pipeline
- Better compression and handling of tables and text content

## Future Enhancements
- Could add plots and visualizations directly embedded in Word documents
- Potential for custom Word templates with organizational branding
- Option for both Word and PDF formats if needed
- Integration with additional statistical tests as they are added

## Current Progress Update

1. **Data Exploration Section:**
   - `download_descriptive_interpretation_pdf` → Complete Descriptive Report (Word)
   - `download_plot_interpretation_pdf` → Complete Plot Analysis Report (Word)
   - `download_correlation_interpretation_pdf` → Complete Correlation Analysis Report (Word)

2. **Data Management Section:**
