# SEVA - Enhanced Word Document Reports Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Socio-Economic Vulnerability Analyzer (SEVA) application to generate comprehensive, detailed, and professionally structured Word documents that mirror R Markdown reports with embedded visualizations, statistical outputs, and interpretations.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics Report Enhanced**
- **Before**: Basic statistics table with minimal interpretation
- **After**: Comprehensive analysis including:
  - Complete descriptive statistics (N, Mean, Median, Mode, SD, Variance, Min, Max, Range, Skewness, Kurtosis)
  - Embedded histograms and box plots with overlaid statistics
  - Coefficient of Variation analysis
  - Outlier detection and analysis
  - Correlation matrix visualization (for multiple variables)
  - Dynamic interpretations based on actual data values
  - Professional R Markdown structure with table of contents

### 2. **Normality Testing Report Enhanced**
- **Before**: Basic Shapiro-Wilk test results
- **After**: Comprehensive assumption testing including:
  - Multiple normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Jarque-Bera)
  - Detailed descriptive statistics with interpretations
  - Embedded visualizations:
    - Histogram with density plot and normal overlay
    - Q-Q plots for normality assessment
    - Box plots for outlier identification
    - Residuals plots
  - Homogeneity of variance testing (when applicable)
  - Visual group comparisons
  - Comprehensive test result interpretation
  - Practical recommendations for analysis methods
  - Methodology and limitations sections

### 3. **Regression Analysis Report Enhanced**

  - Model fit statistics (R², Adjusted R², AIC, BIC, etc.)
  - Individual coefficient interpretations
  - Multiple residual diagnostic plots
  - Comprehensive assumption testing:
    - Normality of residuals (multiple tests)
    - Homoscedasticity (Breusch-Pagan)
    - Independence (Durbin-Watson)
    - Multicollinearity (VIF analysis)
  - Business interpretation and practical recommendations
  - Methodology documentation and limitations
